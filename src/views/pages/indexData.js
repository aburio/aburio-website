This critical move transformed the algorithm from a \'black box\' into a transparent and insightful tool, empowering our supply and ops team with actionable insights and significantly boosting trust in our system. </p> <p class="card-text"> <span class="fw-medium">This strategic shift profoundly optimized our operations, evidenced by a 98% automation rate in replenishment orders and a tenfold decrease in support inquiries about order content.</span> My collaborative approach with tech, supply, and ops teams not only tackled immediate challenges but also established a strong foundation for scalable, sustainable operations, securing long-term success. </p>',
