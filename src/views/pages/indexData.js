          As Lead Product Manager at Gorillas, a German quick-commerce leader and acquirer of Frichti, I spearheaded the launch and development of an API-based service within a challenging two-month timeframe. <span class="fw-medium">This service enabled retailers to rapidly deploy ultra-fast delivery services through the Gorillas store network.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Leading discussions with partners, marketing, operations, product, and tech teams, I ensured that the API blended advanced features with operational efficiency. This collaborative approach resulted in a product that not only met our partners\' needs to enter the ultra-fast delivery market but also upheld Gorillas\' high service standards.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          The API provided a holistic quick-commerce solution, leveraging the Frichti tech stack with dynamic warehouse allocation, precise delivery ETA projections, and real-time synchronization of available product assortments and stock levels.

        <p class="card-text">
          <span class="fw-medium">It played a pivotal role in forging partnerships with major retailers such as Jumbo (Netherlands) and Monoprix (France), extending our product offerings, and reinforcing our status as a leader in the ultra-fast delivery sector.</span>

          <span class="fw-medium">This strategic shift profoundly optimized our operations, evidenced by a 98% automation rate in replenishment orders and a tenfold decrease in support inquiries about order content.</span> My collaborative approach with tech, supply, and ops teams not only tackled immediate challenges but also established a strong foundation for scalable, sustainable operations, securing long-term success.

        description: `<p class="card-text">At Frichti, alongside my work on the automated replenishment web app, I was also responsible for enhancing the warehouse mobile app. <span class="fw-medium">I led a important revamp of the order picking featureâ€”a task that initially seemed superfluous, as the mean picking velocity was meeting targets. However, a deeper dive into the data and on-field observations revealed a significant onboarding challenge: new warehouse employees were taking at least three weeks to achieve the expected picking times.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          The root of the issue was clear. The initial design of the picking feature, created during a period when Frichti primarily delivered ready-to-eat meals, lacked a Product Manager's touch. It was business-centric, not user-centric, missing crucial product information in the picking view and requiring employees to be familiar with the entire warehouse assortment to reach full efficiency.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
        <span class="fw-medium">Addressing this, the new user-centered UI I introduced not only improved the picking velocity by 10% for existing employees but also drastically shortened the learning curve for new hires, enabling them to meet picking velocity targets within their first week.</span> This enhancement significantly optimized warehouse operations and reinforced the importance of a user-focused approach in product development.
